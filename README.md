# Simple Finance Calculator

This repository contains a simple finance calculator that allows the user to calculate their interest on an investment or calculate the amount that should be repaid on a home loan each month.

## Prerequisites
The program is written in Python and requires Python 3 to be installed on your machine.

## How to Use
To use the finance calculator, simply run the finance_calculators.py file in your preferred Python environment.

When you run the program, you will be presented with a menu that prompts you to choose either 'investment' or 'bond'.

If you choose 'investment', you will be asked to input the amount of money you are depositing, the annual interest rate (as a decimal), and the total number of years you plan on investing. You will also be asked if you would like simple or compound interest. The program will then calculate and display the total amount you will earn on your investment, rounded to two decimal places.

If you choose 'bond', you will be asked to input the present value of the house, the annual interest rate (as a decimal), and the number of months over which the bond will be repaid. The program will then calculate and display the amount you will have to pay on a home loan each month, rounded to two decimal places.
